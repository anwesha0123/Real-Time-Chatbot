# Real-Time Chatbot with Emotion-Based Responses

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project implements a real-time chatbot that combines simple rule-based logic with emotion triggers to deliver appropriate responses. The system leverages Flask for backend processing, custom dialogue management and emotion-based triggers to create an engaging conversational experience.
The users can enjoy their time by sharing their thoughts & feelings to a chatbot which responds in real-time based on the predefined logic. The WebApp has access to quick buttons for simplicity and ease or users can write their message as well in the chat area.

## 🎯 Project Approach

Our approach centers around developing a **human-like conversational experience** by integrating rule-based logic into chatbot responses. Now, Users can enjoy seamless conversation with the chatbot and can vent their frustation which makes their mood lighter. We've implemented a sophisticated system that:

1. **Analyzes user input** for emotional intent
2. **Triggers appropriate responses** based on emotions
3. **Maintains conversation flow** through structured dialogue management
4. **Provides real-time interaction** with minimal latency

### Technical Strategy
- **Modular Architecture**: Separation of concerns with distinct files for logic, data, and presentation
- **Emotion-Driven Logic**: Custom algorithms to detect and respond to user emotions
- **Scalable Design**: Cloud-hosted solution with responsive frontend
- **Data-Driven Responses**: JSON-based dialogue system for easy maintenance and updates

## 📁 Project Structure & File Documentation

### **app.py** -
This is the main Flask application server handling HTTP requests and routing. It initializes Flask web server and integrates emotion logic with dialogue flow.

### **logic.py** - 
It is the main functional module for emotion detection and response logic. It maps detected emotions to appropriate response categories by choosing responses based on dialog flow.

### **dialogflow.json** -
It contains the structured dialogue system containing all bot responses and triggers. It is predefined but can be modified later for further enhancement.

### **index.html** -
It is responsible for providing the semantic structure of the chat interface with Flask integration and responsive layout.

### **styles.css** -
It styles the responsive, accessible and interactive UI with a clean and modern design.

### **scripts.js** -
It handles real-time chat logic including user input, rule-based communication and dynamic message updates.

```

### **Detailed Process Flow**

1. **User Interaction**: User visits the webapp and types a message
2. **Frontend Processing**: JavaScript validates input and sends a request
3. **Backend Reception**: Flask receives the message via POST request
4. **Emotion Analysis**: logic.py analyzes the message for emotion based triggers
5. **Response Selection**: dialogflow.json is queried for appropriate responses
6. **Frontend Update**: JavaScript receives response and updates chat interface
7. **Visual Feedback**: Message appears with smooth animations
